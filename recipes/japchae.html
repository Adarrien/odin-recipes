        </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Place the beef strips into a medium bowl. Add the “beef marinade” and gently mix the sauce into the meat. Cover the bowl with food wrap and set it aside while you're working on other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slice the onion, carrot, bell pepper, and mushrooms into fine pieces, then place them on a plate.</li>
        <li>Put the sliced mushroom into a medium bowl and add 1 Tbsp of “noodles & mushroom marinade” mixture. Mix them well. Set it aside until you cook it (in about 20 mins).</li>
        <li>Blanch the spinach in rolling boiling water (5 to 10 seconds). Drain the water and quickly cool it down by running it under cold tap water. Squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water and put it into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Use 1/4 tsp fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, and 1 tsp toasted sesame oil to season the spinach. Mix them gently and evenly.Put it into a large mixing bowl where we will be adding the rest of the prepared ingredients in later.</li>
        <li>Boil some water in a large pot. Once the water starts to boil (6 to 8 mins later), add the noodles and boil them for 6 to 7 mins. Drain the water. Rinse in cold water to cool down and let the water drain for 1 to 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Cut the noodles with a pair of kitchen scissors a couple of times. (Between 15 to 20 cm / 6 to 8 inches length is good). Move the noodles into a mixing bowl and pour in the rest of the “noodles & mushroom marinade” mixture. Mix them well. Set it aside until you cook it (in about 10 mins)</li>
        <li>Add oil to a well heated pan. Cook the onion with a pinch of salt over low to medium heat until it softens (1-2 mins). Transfer it to the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add more oil if necessary. Cook the carrots with a pinch of salt over medium heat until it softens (1-2 mins). Transfer it to the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add more oil if necessary. Cook the red capsicum with a pinch of salt over low to medium heat until it softens (1-2 mins). Transfer it to the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add more oil if necessary. Pour in the marinated mushroom (incl. the residue sauce from the bowl) and stir fry until it is cooked (1-2 mins) over low to medium heat. Transfer it to the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add more oil if necessary. Pour in the marinated meat and stir fry until it is cooked (2-3 mins) over medium heat. Transfer it to the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add more oil if necessary. Stir fry the marinated noodles until the noodles are well coated with the sauce (2-3 mins) over low to medium heat. Transfer it to the large mixing bowl.</li>
