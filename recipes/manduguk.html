        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mandu-guk is a traditional Korean soup that features dumplings called "mandu" as a key ingredient. Mandu are typically filled with a mixture of minced meat, vegetables, tofu, and sometimes noodles. 
            The soup itself is made by simmering the dumplings in a clear broth along with various ingredients such as vegetables, seaweed, and sometimes beef or anchovy stock.
